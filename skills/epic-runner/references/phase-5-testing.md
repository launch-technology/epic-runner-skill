# Phase 5: Manual Testing & Fixes

Your job is to systematically verify the implementation against the story's acceptance
criteria, verification steps, and definition of done — and fix any issues found.

## Prerequisites

Read these from the state file paths:

- The story document — for Acceptance Criteria, Verification Steps, and Definition of Done.
- The implementation plan — for `testing_changes` items.

## Step 1: Build Verification

Run these checks and report results:

1. **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — no type errors
2. **Lint**: `npm run lint` — no lint errors
3. **Build**: `npm run build` — build succeeds with no errors

If any fail, fix the issues immediately and re-run until all pass.

## Step 2: Automated Tests

If the project has automated tests:

1. Run the test suite: `npm test` (or equivalent)
2. Report results: how many passed, how many failed
3. If any tests fail, determine if the failure is:
   - A regression caused by this story → fix it
   - A pre-existing failure → note it but do not fix it (out of scope)

## Step 3: Manual Verification Steps

Walk through each Verification Step from the story document. For each step:

1. Describe what you're checking
2. Describe how you're verifying it (what commands to run, what to look for)
3. Report: PASS or FAIL
4. If FAIL: describe the issue, fix it, re-verify, and confirm the fix

If verification steps involve UI interactions that can't be automated (clicking through
the app in a browser), describe what you checked in the code and what the user should
verify manually. Be specific about what to look for.

## Step 4: Acceptance Criteria Check

Go through each acceptance criterion from the story document:

```
Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] [Criterion text] — PASS / FAIL (explanation)
  - [ ] [Criterion text] — PASS / FAIL (explanation)
```

For each criterion, explain how you verified it. If it requires manual browser testing,
tell the user what to check and where.

## Step 5: Definition of Done Check

Go through each item in the Definition of Done:

```
Definition of Done:
  - [ ] All acceptance criteria above are met — PASS / FAIL
  - [ ] No new errors or warnings in browser console — [explain how verified]
  - [ ] All previously working flows still work — [explain how verified]
  - [ ] [Story-specific items] — PASS / FAIL
```

## Step 6: Fix Cycle

If any checks fail:

1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the specific failing check
3. Verify the fix didn't break anything else (re-run typecheck and lint at minimum)
4. Continue until all checks pass

## Step 7: Test Report

Present a summary:

```
Build Verification:
  TypeScript:  PASS/FAIL
  Lint:        PASS/FAIL
  Build:       PASS/FAIL
  Tests:       PASS/FAIL (N passed, N failed)

Verification Steps:
  1. [Step summary] — PASS/FAIL
  2. [Step summary] — PASS/FAIL
  ...

Acceptance Criteria: N/N passed

Definition of Done: N/N passed

Issues Found and Fixed:
  - [description of each fix applied]

Manual Checks for User:
  - [anything the user needs to verify in the browser]
```

## Step 8: Approval Gate

Ask: "All automated checks pass. Here's what you should verify manually in the browser:
[list]. Once you've confirmed, let me know and we'll move to final review."

If the user reports issues from their manual testing, fix them and re-run affected checks.

## Step 9: State File Update

After the user confirms all tests pass:

1. Set `current_phase` to `"review"`.
2. Update `updated_at`.
3. Tell the user: "Testing complete. Run `/epic-runner review` for final review and shipping."
